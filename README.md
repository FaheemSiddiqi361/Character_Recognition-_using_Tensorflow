# Character_Recognition-_using_Tensorflow
## Introduction: 
This report gives the complete details of the processes and the result of the project. Here, a pattern recognition project has been made using the MNIST dataset. This dataset has a huge number of handwritten digits which are to be recognized. A TensorFlow framework using the ANN model has been produced to correctly recognize those digits. The result and the accuracy are well enough to predict the digit pattern in the image form.
## Before Getting Started
You need to check and install some important libraries used for this project. This list has been provided in the "Requirements" file. In the project file, you just need to remove the "#" sign and that library will be installed in your Jupyter notebook. If that library is already installed then you will see the notification as requirements already satisfied.
