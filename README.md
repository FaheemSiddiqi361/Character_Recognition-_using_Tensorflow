# Character_Recognition-_using_Tensorflow
**Introduction:** 
This report gives the complete details of the processes and the result of the project. Here pattern recognition project has been made using the MNIST dataset. This dataset has a huge number of handwritten digits which are to be recognized. A TensorFlow framework using the ANN model has been produced to correctly recognize those digits. The result and the accuracy are well enough to predict the digit pattern in the image form.
