How to Run the Code

Import Libraries

First of all, understand the libraries you will need to import that would help in building and training the model.

Load the MNIST Dataset

Download the MNIST dataset, which contains pictures of handwritten numbers (0-9).

Preprocess the Data

Normalize the images by scaling the pixels to the range of 0 to 1. This way it helps the model in learning fast.

Visualize the Data

View a few of the training examples and their corresponding labels to get a sense of the dataset.

Build the Model

Construct a model by adding those layers which define the functionalities of the artificial neural network.

Compile the Model

Configure the model by specifying how it will be evaluated (loss function), how it will be improved (optimizer), and how its success will be measured (metric).

Train the Model

Fit the model on the training data for a specific number of cycles (epochs) while monitoring its performance on some validation data.

Evaluate the Model

Use unseen data to evaluate the model and obtain its performance in predicting new data.

Make Predictions

In this step, use the model that you have built to predict the classes (numbers) that the test images belong to and see what it predicts.
