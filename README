### How to Run the Code

##Import Libraries

First of all, understand the libraries you will need to import that would help in building and training the model.

##Load the MNIST Dataset

Download the MNIST dataset, which contains pictures of handwritten numbers from 0-9.

##Preprocess the Data

Normalize the images by scaling the pixels to the range of 0 to 1. This way it helps the model in learning fast.

##Visualize the Data

View a few of the training examples and their corresponding labels to get a sense of the dataset.

##Build the Model

Construct a model by adding those layers which define the functionalities of the artificial neural network.

##Compile the Model

Configure the model by specifying how it will be evaluated, how it will be improved, and how its success will be measured.

##Train the Model

Fit the model on the training data for a specific number of epochs while monitoring its performance on some validation data.

##Evaluate the Model

Use unseen data to evaluate the model and obtain its performance in predicting new data.

##Make Predictions

In this step, use the model that you have built to predict the numbers for the test images see what it predicts.
