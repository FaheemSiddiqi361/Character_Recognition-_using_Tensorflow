Steps to Run the Code
Import Libraries
Import the necessary libraries for building and training the model.

Load the MNIST Dataset
Load the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.

Preprocess the Data
Normalize the pixel values of the images to be between 0 and 1.

Visualize the Data
Visualize some of the training images along with their labels to understand the dataset.

Build the Model
Create a Sequential model and add layers to define the architecture of the ANN.

Compile the Model
Compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics for evaluation.

Train the Model
Fit the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs while monitoring its performance on validation data.

Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model on the test data to obtain the test loss and accuracy.

Make Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data and obtain the predicted classes.
